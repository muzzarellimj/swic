/**
 * Set - allows no duplicates. Is an interface.
 *
 * Queues - grocery line, car wash, etc.; first one in, first one out (FIFO). Is an interface. Deque is a double-
 * ended queue.
 *
 * Stacks - stack of trays, recursive stack, etc.; last in, first out (LIFO). Is a class type.
 *
 * To use these data structures, we will learn about the notions of push (add to the list) and pop (remove from the
 * list).  For a stack, there exists the top() method to examine the top of the stack.  For a queue, there exists the
 * front() method to examine the front of the queue.

/**
 * A sequential search is a linear search that parses through each "book" one
 * page at a time to find the necessary information.
 *
 * A binary search is a logarithmic search that  cuts the "book" in half
 * several times until it finds the correct area to search within.
 *
 * Logarithms is undoing exponentiation and therefore the algorithm for our
 * bubble sort is a logarithmic algorithm.
 *
 * MATH: base 10 = log x
 *       base e = ln x
 *       base 2 = lg x
 *
 * ALGORITHMIC ANALYSIS: what we are doing is giving a ranking to our algorithm.
 *      - Big-O Notation (O):
 *      Sequential: O(n) = n (linear)
 *      Binary: O(n) = lg n (logarithmic)
 *      Best algorithm is a constant: O(n) = k / O(n) = 1.
 *
 *      The algorithms that take the least amount of time are the best
 *      (smallest)
 *
 * EMPIRICAL TESTING:

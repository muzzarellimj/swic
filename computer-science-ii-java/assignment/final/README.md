# Orchard
Orchard is a simple Swing-based apple catching game and serves as my semester project for MATH 271 - Computer 
Science: Java II. The goal is simple: catch falling apples in the movable basket. The falling apples include red and 
green, both worth one point, and a magic blue apple, worth five points. Catch twenty-five apples to complete the game!
